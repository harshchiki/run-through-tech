# Code Review

* Good code reviews focus on unexpected outcomes rather than the one-track focus on finding bugs. 
* Do not treat reviews as an interrogation. Rather let code review policies be guided with the explicit intent to improve code style, find alternative solutions, increase learning, and share ownership.
* Criticize ideas, not people
* Question until you don't understand (Be reasonable)
* Don't spoon feed
* Code reviews should essentially become a learning and sharing session.


# Thumb rule - Good code
* As a rule of thumb, good code should be:
    * Functional first — it should work as intended
    * Clean and maintainable second — readability should be high
    * Optimized third — perform as expected in production
*
