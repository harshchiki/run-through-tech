# DB
* ## Polyglot persistence
    * Have a variety of different data storage technologies for different kinds of data.

# Stream Processing
  * To query continuous data stream and detect conditions, quickly, within a small time period from the time of receiving the data. 
  * Its a Big Data technology.
  * Check your own note - Questioning the Lamdba Architecture.md (also has notes on "The LOG" crucial element of all sophisticated Distributed services)
* ## Why do we need stream processing?
    * Some data comes naturally as a continuous never ending stream of events
    * Batch processing (compaction of activity kind of)
    * Sometimes data is huge and it is not even possible to store it.
* ## Responsibilities of an Event Stream Processor 
    * (Data can either be sent directly to the stream processor, have it sent to the broker and the processor essentially a listener will get the data "continuously")
    * Collect data (from a source)
    * deliver to each designated/registered actor
    * ensure ordering (more nuances and exceptions exist)
    * collecting results (from listeners)
    * scaling if the load is high
    * Handling failures
* ## Data Processing Patterns
    * **Bounded data**
        * A finite pool of unstructured data on the left is run through a data processing engine, resulting in corresponding structured data on the right.
        * ![](_resources/2020-05-03-12-16-37.png)
    * **Unbounded data - Batch**
        * As the name suggests
        * At times, also work with an infinite stream of data
    * **Fixed windows**
        * In reality, however, most systems still have a completeness problem to deal with 
            * (What if some of your events are delayed en route to the logs due to a network partition? 
            * What if your events are collected globally and must be transferred to a common location before processing? 
            * What if your events come from mobile devices?), which means **some sort of mitigation might be necessary** (e.g.,** delaying processing until youâ€™re sure all events have been collected or reprocessing the entire batch for a given window whenever data arrive late**).
