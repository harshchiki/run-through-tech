# Management 101
  * The secret of managing people is to keep the ones who hate you away from the ones who havn't yet made up their minds. - Casey Stengel
  * The experience of being managed is the foudnation on which you build your own management philosophy.

### Not so good managers
  * Micro managers
  * Ones who neglect, and seldom meet, mostly for formal feedback meetings
  * Ones who neglect, and meet once in a while to yell at you for something.
  * Abusive managers

### Good managers
  * Who care about you as a person. They want you to grow in your career.
  * Those who teach you important skills and give you valuable feedback.
  * Those who help you navigate difficult situations - those who help you figure out what you need to learn.
  * Those who want you to take their job someday (rasonably soon) 
  * MOST IMPORTANTLY, those who help you understand what is important to focus on, and enable you to have that focus.
  * They know, providing feedback at the right time(and in a timely manner) is more valuable than waiting for a conveninet time to say something.
  * Praise in public, criticize in private.
  * He should be the person who shows you the larger picture of how your work fits into the team's goals, and helps you feel a sense of purpose in a day-to-day work.
    * The most mundane work can turn into a source of pride when you understand how it contributed to theoverall success of the company.
  * Provides mentoring and training.
  * They know and have a fair sense of what the system is looking for and can help you build those achievements and skills.

### 1:1 meetings
  * Creates human connection between you and your manager.
  * To speak privately about things (professionally personal things)
    * So, the meetings should be planned a little in advance, letting both plan a bit before the meeting.

### Feedback and Workplan guidance
   * **Feedback**: 
     * Sooner you get feedback, better it is. Lot better than not getting at all, or at the time of performance review meeting.
     * Asking our manager for advice is a good way to show that you respect him/her.
       * People like to feel helpful, and managers are not immune to this sort of flattery.
   * As you become more senior, the amount of personal feedback you get, both good and bad, is likely to decrease. You are operating at a higher level, and your manager is operating at a very high level. 
     * Expect the type of feedback to change somwhat from personal feedback to team or stratgey related input.
     * Its even more important as become more senior that you feel comfortable driving your 1-1s and bringing topics for discussion or feedback to your manager, because he/she is otherwise unlikely to spend a lot of time on the outside of performance reviews.

### Seeking Promotion/Building your case for Promotion
  * Sitting down with your manager and asking him/her what areas you need to focus on to get promoted is usually a good idea if you are actively seekin a promotion.
  * **If you don't ask your manager about a promotion, do not expect her to just give you one magically**
    * This can become scary.
    * Try to pave your way up, and start doing things (and the way they are done) as you would do after being promoted (without by all means compromizing with your current role's commitments) - also helps you advocate your case for a promotion.
    * **Its very important to ask your manager for specific areas to focus on in order to get that promotion.**
  * At more senior levels of work, opportunities for promotion are much more rare, and your manaer may need you to find and propose the achievements that qualify you for the next level.


### Training ad Career Growth
  * As the main liason between you aren the bureaucracy of the company, your manager holds some responsibility for helping you find training and other resources for your career growth
