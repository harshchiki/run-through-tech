# Identity-based Security and Low-trust Networks
## Motivation
* As we transition to cloud, we move from a relatively static world of dedicated servers, static IP addresses, and a clear network perimeter to the cloud model, which has dynamic pools of compute capacity provisioned on demand, dynamic IP addresses, and no clear perimeter.
* For security teams, this model requires a fundamentally different approach: instead of focusing on a secure network perimeter and the assumption of network trust, the focus is to acknowledge that the network in cloud is inherently "low trust" and move to the idea of securing infrastructure and application services themselves.


## Identities and Vault
* Managing access to secrets in a hybrid world consists of two primary user types
  * Humans: 
    * need to permit or restrict access to create or manage secrets, or manage others who may have access, based on the identity (or identities) the user logged in with.
  * Machines:
