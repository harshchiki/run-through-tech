REST paradigm

The basic features of a RESTful architecture:

1. Stateless: Client data is not stored on the server between interactions and the session is stored client-side (typically in session storage).

2. Client<->Server: There is a separation of concerns between the frontend (client) and the backend (server). They operate independently of each other and both are replaceable.

3. Cache: Data from the server can be cached on the client, which can improve performance speed.

4. Utilizes standardized base URLs and standardized methods to perform actions to manipulate, add or delete data.
