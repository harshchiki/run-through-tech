# API Guidelines

* API-first principles allow us to address developers directly.

* As a developer - internal or external - I can have a swift look at an API description and it either “speaks” to me or it doesn’t. Either I find what I’m looking for in API playground and start using it within a minute, or I move on to another offering.

* And maybe later look at the API spec to understand it in more detail, but in most cases that’s not a requirement to get started.

* API-first defines our services offering as self-service and ready-to-use via a remote HTTP API.

* In a way, API-first services are the equivalent of the CQ and AEM “Quickstart” mechanism that we invented in on-premise times: provide a way for enterprise developers to get started immediately with our services, without any unnecessary hurdles.
