## May 2021
* By 2025, more than 80% of organizations will identify themselves to have implemented advanced or expert level API strategies
* By 2025, more than 75% of organizations will directly or indirectly monetize APIs
* By 2024, API abuses and related data breaches will nearly double.
* Software engineers, developers ww have accepted APIs as primary choice to connect systems, applications and things to build impactful and composable software architectures. 
* 70% of organizations are using API management and mediation to build their digital platforms.

## Don’t create an API governance bottleneck
* APIs that are created locally but never catalogued or managed or rarely used or reused can introduce security risks, data, and privacy concerns and prevent adoption. 
* The goal of an API strategy should be to provide a framework for all stakeholders to develop, manage and govern APIs without introducing barriers to engineers, developers or specific business areas. 
* Achieved through “adaptive governance” model using automatic validation of APIs against style guides, rather than introducing bureaucratic process of API approvals. 
* Each team should actively participate and contribute in federated API governance.


## Treat APIs as Products, Even if You Don’t Plan to Monetize Them
* Gartner’s interactions with clients indicate growing trend of using APIs to advance digital business strategies in post pandemic era. 
* Elevate API beyond technical purposes to being products ensure alignment to business goals. 
* Treating APIs as products involves adopting a consumer-centric product mindset for creation, organization and management of APIs. 
* API part of product manager focus – including API roadmaps, measuring business outcomes.
* Direct monetization of APIs is not primary reason why APIs should be treated as products – helps to prioritize, build and manage APIs through lifecycle.


## Discover Your APIs Before Hackers Do
* Each new API increases the surface area of attack. Each year exploitation of APIs causes millions of user sensitive information to be stolen
* Need security strategy focus on threat protection, well-refined access control and data privacy
* Watch out for shadow APIs – blind spot. Adopt a DevSecOps strategy. 


## APIs Have Lifecycle, Beyond Their Development
* Spans initial design to when API is no longer used. 
* Four stages:
  * Planning and initial design
  * Right APIs to enable integration and development
  * Implementation and testing
  * Deploy and run
* API operational management, security, format translation and usage metrics. 
* Advanced security, analytics to measure API business value monetization
* Versioning and retirement
* Governed API versioning and support for API retirement. 
* Need to consider functional, performance and security testing.


## APIs are Key to Integration, but Aren’t Only for Integration
* Composable architecture highly desirable of modern business – APIs are essential
* Enable mobile and multiexperience applications, microservices and API oriented integration architectures. 
* Must utilize APIs for their potential for different architectural patterns unique to business critical user experiences and construct agile and resilient composable business architecture. 


## API Marketplaces Have Great Value, but Manage Expectations for Public API Marketplaces
* Success in deploying marketplaces to share APIs across developer teams. Example is adidas develop hub which provides APIs and developer resources
* Public API marketplaces shown less value
* Your Software Engineering Teams Rely More and More on Third-Party APIs
* Most orgs use more APIs than they produce – need to consider health, stability, quality and security of APIs as can result in major incidents (eg. Auth0 lead to Tesla’s entire network going down.
* Adopt an API mediation strategy that involves external APIs.


## Most APIs are REST, but Don’t Forget the Rest of Them
* Natural given growth of web applications, mobile apps, user experiences and architectural frameworks that support these. 
* Not suitable for all scenarios. Non-REST approaches:
* Asynchronous APIs (including use of web hooks and AsyncAPI as description language)
  * gRPC
  * MQTTT
  * GraphQL


## Your Team Is Likely to Use Multiple API Gateways, Which Could Come from Different Vendors
* Most high-performing mobile and multiexperience apps and high-volume device interactions (eg. BFF patterns, IoT interfaces) introduces performance concerns and architectural problems as not a single place for API gateway. 
* Concern of bottlenecks and single point of failure
* Drives need for multiple API gateways. Consider API management platforms that support multiple different API gateways. 


## API Management Solutions Vary Widely, Must Meet the Needs of Team
* Encompass: design, testing, monitoring, security, portals and ecosystem management, marketplaces
